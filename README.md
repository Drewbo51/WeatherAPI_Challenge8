# WeatherAPI_Challenge8

1. I utilized two API's in my challenge. The first API helps by grabbing the LAT and LON coordinates and plugging them into the URL for the following AJAX call. Also it grabs the current weather conditions(except for UV index which I actually grabbed from AJAX call 2).

2. I added another FontAwesome link, this one for version 5.15. Also I added a CSS stylesheet of my own to this challenge.

3. Using local storage to store persistent data was a real challenge but ended up utilizing an array and the 'push' method, then subsequently emptying the array for each click.

4. I was unable to create a way to click each search history item and reinvoke the weather data.
